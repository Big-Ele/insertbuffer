InsertBuffer is an asynchronous queue in front of a MySQL server.  It's
designed to buffer high volume INSERT statements to work around temporary
I/O bottlenecks.

Requires Python 2.7, MySQL-Python and pysignalfd (provided as a Git
submodule).  Run `make boot' if you have virtualenv installed.

(Note that insertbufferd.py and insertbuffer.php are licensed under
different terms; the former is GPL and the latter is MIT.)
